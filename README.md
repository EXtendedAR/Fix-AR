# Fix-AR

### Problem found and proposed solution
Although millions of people drive daily as part of their routine, a large portion of the population lacks basic mechanical knowledge. According to a FinanceBuzz survey (2025) of 1,000 drivers in the United States, 64% of users admit to postponing some type of vehicle maintenance. Among the most common are oil changes (28%), tire replacements (17%), checking the "Check Engine" light (17%), and wheel alignments (16%). This reflects a trend toward postponing tasks related to basic mechanics, often due to a lack of knowledge.

Given this scenario, our proposed solution is developing an application using Augmented Reality (AR). Its main function will be to help people without prior mechanical knowledge perform these types of tasks quickly and efficiently.
